        "title": "James Damore Is Not Entirely Wrong",
        "content": """All the way back in the distant time of last week, it seemed that everyone was talking about “the Google memo,” written by a brogrammer named James Damore who was subsequently fired. Better writers such as Conor Friedersdorf have already taken the commentariat to task for misrepresenting the contents of his memo, David Brooks cited some evolutionary psychologists who backed up some of his claims, and Damore himself added a self-serving note at the head of his memo, which you can still read here, which I will ignore for the moment.

Damore begins his “memo” — more of a sophomoric essay, really — by discussing left- and right-wing biases, which is useful for discussing the rest of what he has to say. Later on, the question of why he “has to say” it can be raised, but it is not yet relevant. Under the heading “Left Biases,” he includes among these “Compassion for the weak,” “Disparities are due to injustices,” “Humans are inherently cooperative,” “Change is good (unstable),” “Open,” and “Idealist”; under “Right Biases,” we have the polar opposites “Respect for the strong/authority,” “Disparities are natural and just,” “Humans are inherently competitive,” “Change is dangerous (stable),” “Closed,” and “Pragmatic.” In a footnote, Damore identifies himself as “a classical liberal and strongly value individualism and reason.” All well and good, so far.

He further adds that neither left nor right “is 100 percent correct and both viewpoints are necessary for a functioning society or, in this case, company.” In his opinion, “Google’s left bias has created a politically correct monoculture that maintains its hold by shaming dissenters into silence.” Once that is out of the way, he moves on to the part that got him fired: population-level distributions of traits between men and women that “may explain why we don’t see equal representation of women in tech and leadership.”

He adds a disclaimer, as clear as crystal: “Many of these differences are small and there’s significant overlap between men and women, so you can’t say anything about an individual given these population level distributions.” In an accompanying graphic, Damore states, “Reducing people to their group identity and assuming the average is representative ignores this overlap (this is bad and I don’t endorse that).” Under the heading “Personality Differences,” he writes that women, “on average, have more openness directed towards feelings and aesthetics rather than ideas.” This is a questionable statement but it is not necessarily sexist.

He also says women, again on average, have more “neuroticism (higher anxiety, lower stress tolerance).” This is dangerously close to the misogynistic adage “bitches be crazy,” and by his standard that makes me a woman. His larger point is that “we need to stop assuming that gender gaps imply sexism,” which on its face makes some sense. Under a section titled “Men’s higher drive for status,” Damore continues: “We always ask why we don’t see women in top leadership positions, but we never ask why we see so many men in these jobs.” The reason for this? “Status is the primary metric that men are judged on.” What is the “primary metric” on which women are judged? There’s no answer for that.

Nonetheless, “the same forces that lead men into high pay/high stress jobs in tech and leadership cause men to take undesirable and dangerous jobs like coal mining, garbage collection, and firefighting, and suffer 93 percent of work-related deaths.” In another interesting point, Damore writes that while feminism “has made great progress in freeing women from the female gender role,” men as a group “are still very much tied to the male gender role. If we, as a society, allow men to be more ‘feminine,’ then the gender gap will shrink.” This may be the clearest proof that this fellow is not some troglodyte.

In what may be the key section — titled “Why we’re blind” — he makes the following observations:

We all have biases and use motivated reasoning to dismiss ideas that run counter to our internal values. Just as some on the Right deny science that runs counter to the “God > humans > environment” hierarchy (e.g., evolution and climate change), the Left tends to deny science concerning biological differences between people (e.g., IQ and sex differences). ... In addition to the Left’s affinity for those it sees as weak, humans are generally biased towards protecting females. As mentioned before, this likely evolved because males are biologically disposable and because women are generally more cooperative and agreeable than men. ... Nearly every difference between men and women is interpreted as a form of women’s oppression.
Under the heading “Suggestions,” Damore prefaces it by saying, “I hope it’s clear that I’m not saying that diversity is bad... My larger point is that we have an intolerance for ideas and evidence that don’t fit a certain ideology. I’m also not saying that we should restrict people to certain gender roles; I’m advocating for quite the opposite: treat people as individuals, not as just another member of their group (tribalism).”

His “thesis,” as it were, is all about blind spots, but there is a glaring one in which he is engaged: There is no acknowledgement anywhere of personality differences that cut across gender. This is especially odd when considering how much stock he puts into individualism. Another is his argument, as a whole, is ahistorical, since there is no mention of the fact that for most of human history, men, as a group, have dominated social relations. It is not “anti-men” to point that out, just as much as it not “anti-women” to broach the subject of evolutionary psychology when making claims about aggregate trait differences among populations.

Judging by what he actually wrote, Damore does not appear to be some sexist pig, but rather is guilty of sloppy work that is packaged in a way that makes it look edgy and provocative. It is a shame Google fired him, because instead they could have dropped some knowledge."""

        "content": """Over the weekend, a Google employee wrote what has been described as a 10-page "manifesto against diversity." Boiling down 10 pages into a short column, and then commenting on it, is impossible.

But, the long and the short of his opinion seems to be that women are underrepresented in tech because of psychological differences between women and men, not because of bias, and women are underrepresented in the top tiers of leadership because of their own preferences, not discrimination. Ultimately, he believes that "diversity" initiatives should focus more on ideological diversity, and less on immutable characteristics like race and gender.
Cue the outrage and applause machines -- depending on which political tribe you belong to. Of course, the outrage machine is calling for him to be tracked down and fired. I take the opposite view, but not because I agree with him. In fact, I mostly disagree with him, though I think he makes some good arguments -- but that is beside the point. I categorically oppose the notion that if you have an opinion that deviates too far from that which is considered to be "politically correct," then the appropriate punishment is that you should lose your job -- and preferably not be hired anywhere else, either.

Some are tempted to call this a "First Amendment" issue. Let me be clear, it is not. The government is not involved, and thus this is not a violation of anyone's constitutional rights. But, one of the pillars that holds up our First Amendment is the "marketplace of ideas" theory -- that ideas should compete in the free market, and that through wide-open and robust debate, we will advance.
In ideology-driven authoritarian regimes, locking someone out of the labor market because you don't like their ideas is a common approach. Behind the Iron Curtain, for instance, if you weren't sufficiently Marxist, it didn't necessarily mean a trip to the gulag. You would just find that you were out of a job. Of course, the blowback against this Google employee is not top-down authoritarianism or orthodoxy enforced by the state. No, in America when you violate the PC code of conduct, a small cadre of people will dust off the outrage machine -- and millions of people will fuel it.
The result of such a lynch-mob mentality fueled by intolerance for different points of view is twofold. First, it winnows out those who might disagree, making the cone of tolerance and ideological pluralism ever-more narrow. Second, it drives holders of minority viewpoints or people with differing ideas underground, and causes them to seek out and communicate only those who agree with them -- which can push them to radicalization.
These results destroy our marketplace of ideas -- replacing it with a melee of venom.
Trump as Julius Caesar -- What could go wrong?
Trump as Julius Caesar -- What could go wrong?
Today, that melee is largely a left-spinning gyre -- but let us not forget that the right does this, too. During the Red Scare and the McCarthy era, for example. Or, even during the Bush years, when being anti-war meant being anti-American. Or, even recently when Trump supporters considered a particular production of a Shakespeare play to be too (supposedly) offensive.
With respect to the substance of the manifesto, I see it as almost irrelevant. To me, if you read it and are completely outraged or uniformly in favor, then you are part of the problem. If you can read anyone's opinion, spread out over 10 pages, and find nothing with which you agree, then you're almost certainly not thinking. Similarly, if you can read this guy's entire memo and find yourself blindly nodding, then you probably aren't using your brain either.
But, if we are to boil down his view, it is this: that we do need diversity but it should be focused on diversity of thought, not simply diversity that looks good to some in a group photo. In that regard, I agree with him. Meanwhile, I find the claim dubious that women are somehow genetically predisposed away from engineering. But I agree that it isn't sexism that dissuades them from it, but more likely simply preferences they may have.
Nevertheless, I think that it is completely valid for a company to believe that adding more gender and ethnic diversity to its pool of talent is better business. And if that's the case, then in the marketplace they should be able to make that decision. I just also happen to think that the company that looks for diversity of intellectual thought is, in the end, going to be the company that has greater success.

        "title": "Was Google Right To Fire James Damore?",
        "content": """Do you think Google was right or wrong in firing James Damore for his “Anti-Diversity Manifesto”? originally appeared on Quora: the place to gain and share knowledge, empowering people to learn from others and better understand the world.

Answer by Dandan Zhu, Headhunter, Career Coach, Investor, & Podcaster, on Quora:

Unequivocally, Google was right and within their rights to fire James Damore for his Manifesto.

Having read his manifesto, from a headhunter’s and businessperson’s perspective, here are a few reasons why Google had to get rid of Damore:

#1. To stay commercially viable. Damore criticizes the left-wing nature of modern business culture for needing to be politically correct. He recommends that companies embrace conservative views. That is going against the grain of what stakeholders, vendors, business partners, and more importantly, consumers, want.

Consumers include those who are female and minorities. To paint you a picture of the need to please these demographics: according to the US Census, almost half of people in the US born in 2010 are not white. Furthermore, half of the population more or less of every age group (elderly being more so) are WOMEN.

Add in the whites who like minorities and the males who support women, you can imagine how disastrous this type of PR fiasco can be, how much money will be lost if companies condone racism and the validity of male-superiority, which his manifesto tries to prove.

Consumers’ buying power and their feelings, are at the core of how businesses can stay relevant (profitable) or not. If ignored, customer demographics will unite against the company that angers them (think Beehive at any insults directed towards Bey). Money talks. Businesses listen. They’re not going to protect one guy and lose billions in the process.

#2. To recruit future hires and hold on to their existing staff. Right-wing ideals like limiting female reproductive rights, enforcing religious dogma disguised as “family” values, anti-minority, and anti-immigration policies, literally will ruin a tech company’s hiring future and present!

Tech companies need foreign labor, in part, to survive. They heavily rely on H1B visas to recruit highly talented staff who know technical skills that most domestic Americans don’t because the US government spends 8x on military than education, leading to a dire gap in STEM education across the board.

Highly-skilled employees, many of whom will be upset by Damore’s views, are unlikely to stay with a company that allows such blatant disrespect for women and minorities. Therefore, a company has to protect retention and make an example out of Damore for stupidly making public his ignorant views. Had Damore kept his views to himself, he would still be employed (many people share his views), but he made the mistake of showing his hand publicly. Not a great move.

#3. To remain socially accepted and widely admired by the majority of American (and global) citizenry. The global trend and mentality of the 21st century embraces continued openness, global equality, eventual eradication of poverty, uplifting of the masses, reducing disease, environmental protection, and promoting a more harmonious and peaceful world. We expect companies to follow a similar moral code: one of respect for others’ dignity.

Outside of war-mongering countries, most citizens globally don’t want death, disease, famine, and hate to rule their lives. Outside of the deeply mentally-ill terrorist organizations and authoritarian leadership, most humans want happiness. That includes respecting each other. Embracing each others’ differences.

Global reputation matters. Global companies, like Google, need to adhere and abide by a global policy, which leads to my last point:

#4. Google had a right to fire Damore, due to HR policies prohibiting a hostile work environment, to say the least! Damore’s writing and sharing of his views shook their existing culture to their core. The revelation that someone within their midst, hiding in plain sight, was all along (!) harboring such disturbing views negatively distracts and disrupts a culture that previously was one of unity, equality, and growth.

The audacity that someone dares to make public their belief that one demographic is more deserving of and biologically inclined to achieve technical success than another, is so abrasive to the existing culture, that it legally creates a hostile environment, unacceptable by the majority of employees and leadership.

Should a company allow this type of behavior to continue, every colleague and employee can pursue and win a class-action lawsuit that proves Google tolerates discrimination and endorses male-superiority thinking. The damage brought on by such a lawsuit would not bring Google down, but would ruin enough goodwill internally and externally that the costs could be staggering in terms of customers lost and employees lost to other firms, causing employee replacement costs (recruiter fees) to skyrocket!

In conclusion

As cleverly and articulately that Damore tried to write and promote his way of thinking, citing fancy and meaningless graphs using pseudo-science, people see the core message at the heart of his manifesto: that women and minorities are inherently < males.

If a company tolerates this type of open disregard for colleagues, managers, and leadership, how can other employees enjoy that type of work environment? Where now it’s acceptable to tolerate bigotry, discrimination, and superiority right in front of your face? Next to your own desk? Close to where you work? No company would set themselves up for that type of legal and emotional headache.

And hence, ladies and gentlemen, Damore was unquestionably fired to minimize the damage he has already created for his firm, himself, and others that his narrow-minded thinking has hurt.

        "title": "James Damore just filed a class action lawsuit against Google, saying it discriminates against white male conservatives",
        "content": """James Damore, a former Google  engineer who was fired in August after posting a memo to an internal Google message board arguing that women may not be equally represented in tech because they are biologically less capable of engineering, has filed a class action lawsuit against the company in Santa Clara Superior Court in Northern California.

His claims: that Google unfairly discriminates against white men whose political views are unpopular with its executives.

Damore is joined in the 161-page suit by another former Google engineer named David Gudeman, who spent three years with Google working on a query engine. According to Gudeman’s LinkedIn profile, he left the company in December 2016 and has been self-employed since.

The lawsuit, filed by Dhillon Law Group, says it aims to represent all employees of Google who’ve been discriminated against due to their “perceived conservative political views by Google,” due to “their male gender by Google” and “due to their Caucasian race by Google.”

More specifically, it accuses Google of singling out, mistreating and systematically punishing and terminating employees who “expressed views deviating from the majority view at Google on political subjects raised in the workplace and relevant to Google’s employment policies and its business, such as ‘diversity’ hiring policies, ‘bias sensitivity’ or ‘social justice’…”

Damore isn’t holding back any punches here. According to his filing, Google employs “illegal hiring quotas to fill its desired percentages of women and favored minority candidates, and openly shames managers of business units who fail to meet their  quotas—in the process, openly denigrating male and Caucasian employees as less favored than others.”

The suit also claims that the “numerical presence of women celebrated at Google” was based “solely due to their gender” while the “presence of Caucasians and males was mocked with ‘boos’ during companywide weekly meetings.”

Somewhat redundantly, it adds that Damore, Gudeman and “other class members” were “ostracized, belittled, and punished for their heterodox political views, and for the added sin of their birth circumstances of being Caucasians and/or males.”

The lawsuit is seeking monetary, non-monetary and punitive remedies.

Damore’s firing last summer became the talk of the nation, with many in Silicon Valley outraged that Google didn’t act even more swiftly to terminate him. Elsewhere, many wondered whether the firing would have a chilling effect on employees’ ability to openly discuss their viewpoints.

Google said it fired Damore for violating its code of conduct and advancing “harmful gender stereotypes in our workplace.” Damore meanwhile began a kind of press tour, denouncing the company for being close-minded and worse. In an interview with CNBC, for example, he compared being a conservative at Google to “being gay in the 1950s.”

In a press conference this afternoon, Damore’s attorney, Harmeet Dhillon, a California representative for the Republican National Committee, elaborated more on the very lengthy complaint and argued that her current clients are far from alone.

In fact, she said she spoke with “dozens” of employees at Google to formulate the lawsuit and that she expects there will be “future lawsuits” to explore, as well.

To underscore her point that Google’s policies need to be amended, she cited so-called TGIF meetings at Google, telling reporters that during Damore’s tenure, “managers were called out and shamed and mocked if they didn’t have 50/50 gender parity in [their respective] units.” She called the goal “fair” but asked, rhetorically: “How do you get there? Job fairs. Making yourself more attractive. Not by saying, ‘White guy, you can’t have that job because that’s reserved for a woman or [other] minority.'”

Asked separately who is financing the suit, Dhillon told us in an email earlier today that “nobody but my law firm is financing the lawsuit at this time. We may choose to seek funding in the future, but neither Peter Thiel (I have been asked by others) or anyone else is involved besides my clients and my firm.” (Thiel, the billionaire investor, famously financed multiple lawsuits against Gawker Media.)

The new suit isn’t the only one Google is having to defend itself against. In September, three female former Google employees filed a lawsuit against the company, saying it discriminates against women. To wit, says the suit, Google pays women at all levels of the company less than men, as well as assigns them lower job tiers with less opportunity for upward mobility.

Last month, a fourth complainant joined their suit.

The Labor Department is separately investigating systemic pay discrimination at Google. The company says it hasn’t found a pay gap in its own analysis.

        "content": """Not all opinions are equal, but some people seem to wish they were. Former Google engineer James Damore, who you may remember as the author of an eye-poppingly sexist company-wide memo about why men are naturally better at computers than women, is now suing the company for discrimination against conservatives. The memo claimed that it was wrong for Google, a company with 80% of its technical roles held by men, to be pursuing diversity. Damore joins a dull retinue of bad actors asking whether, if it’s wrong to judge people because of their gender or the colour of their skin, is it not also wrong to judge people because they happen to have certain “unorthodox” ideas about social Darwinism?

The answer is no, and Damore was fired. The 28-year-old promptly became a martyr for an alt-right that believes that losing your job for being a sexist arsehole is an injustice equivalent to facing centuries of structural oppression. Damore is convinced that he lost his job because of what he thinks, rather than because of how he behaved, and that he is being punished by a culture of “political correctness”, which is what used to be called human decency.

He is not alone. Donald Trump received his strongest support at the polls among Americans who believed that men, Christians and, in particular, white people, were being unfairly discriminated against. The new right feeds off this narrative of victimhood. It’s seductive. It allows the vertebrally challenged to feel justified in their crass and reactionary opinions, and righteous when they face a backlash. It’s not you, it says – it’s them. You have been used to privilege, so equality feels like prejudice.

 Fairness and justice are not achieved by calculating the mean average of everyone’s opinion, whatever they happen to be
The trouble is that, as most children learn, there is a material difference between feelings and reality. Only someone who has never faced real prejudice in their lives could possibly believe that centuries of violence and injustice are any sort of equivalent to not being allowed to scream and pull your pants down in public. It’s the upside-down logic of individuals so thoroughly swallowed by their own self-regard that they scream censorship when someone talks back to them, and prejudice when someone calls them to account for being a bully. This type of weaponised ignorance is not just dim, it’s dangerous.

Those of us who actually care about tolerance tend to get thrown off course when someone tells us we’re not living up to our ideals. Let me explain, then, why it’s all right to discriminate against conservatives.

Conservatism is a behaviour, a set of opinions, not a fixed identity. Biology is not destiny, and it is certainly not ethics. Nobody tumbles out of the womb with decent politics. No, not even in Sweden. Nobody is born believing that people who die young of preventable diseases because they are unable to afford private healthcare have only themselves to blame for not working harder. That’s a learned, developed standpoint, and one that says a great deal about who a person is, and the choices they’ve made about the world they want to live in.

The new right loves to harp on about “meritocracy”, but it seems to believe that merit can be judged entirely by the market – that human worth is a matter of what you produce, rather than how you behave towards others. In his suit, Damore compares the qualities of “liberal” and “conservative” individuals in the language of a household instruction manual – as objective qualities. Liberals, for example, value “compassion”, whereas conservatives value “authority”.

Even if we countenance this Fisher-Price political analysis, one of these things is not like the other. Worship of authority is not morally equivalent to compassion and concern for your fellow beings, not unless you live in a world where the only thing that matters is the cash value of your raw talent.

It’s perfectly reasonable to judge others by standards of basic decency. Martin Luther King, in his “I have a dream” speech, spoke of his desire to see his children grow up in a world where they would not be judged on the colour of their skin but by the content of their character. Some conservatives today seem to inhabit a universe where those judgments are morally equal.

There is a difference between discrimination on the basis of background and discrimination on the basis of behaviour. The former is a prejudice: literally, a pre-judgment, writing someone off before you’ve even met them. The latter is simply a judgment, and it’s not just alright to judge people on how they treat others – it’s admirable. Fairness and justice are not achieved by calculating the mean average of everyone’s opinion, whatever those opinions happen to be. If my opinion is that you ought to be eaten by a leopard, and your opinion is that you’d rather not, it does not follow that we should compromise by lopping off your least-favourite limb and feeding it to next-door’s cat.

I discriminate against people who are rightwing and conservative. I’m entirely happy to say so. I don’t view it as hypocrisy to judge people by their personal qualities, rather than their background and appearance. If people are bigots and bullies, I will judge them for that. And for those who think it’s hypocrisy to refuse to tolerate intolerance, perhaps they should read the philosopher Karl Popper, who got there decades before me when he wrote of the paradox of tolerance: “If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them.”

It is no accident that the charges the new right loves to fling about in its ballistic culture wars – of hypocrisy, over-sensitivity and intolerance of difference – are practically the watermarks of its own movement. It’s a very human impulse to always be angriest about the things you’re guiltiest of doing to other people. I’m late to everything, but if I get stood up for 10 minutes I am ready to put my fist through the wall of my own hypocrisies. I’m working on that, though, and these days I’m rarely more than 10 minutes late, whereas modern morality has been waiting for Silicon Valley to show up at the party for several decades.

It used to be conservatives who were more concerned with “character”. It is odd that the idea of decency and personal responsibility has now become the domain of progressives. But I believe in fairness, and if the right are going to co-opt the language of tolerance for their own ends, it’s only fair that we should get to pinch something of theirs in good faith. Character matters. How you treat other people matters. Actions have consequences, and sometimes those consequences include other people telling you you’re being a dick. And, yes, that’s hard.

It’s OK to be sensitive to criticism. Plenty of us are a bit wet – but it takes a special sort of person to see that as a reason to sue the swimming pool."""

I understand that we are in the midst of a volatile cultural moment. I understand that many minorities are hurting and scared right now. And that many people don’t believe a white male should be penning provocative pieces that could hurt others further.
However, I believe we are at a critical cultural, political, social and economic moment where the perspective I am putting forth in this post matters and urgently needs to be heard.
I recognize that there are people who I will never convince of this viewpoint and that I will be the target of a lot of negatively charged emotions. So be it. It is important I give voice to an increasingly silenced Trans-Partisan group of Moderates, who are caught in the middle of the race to the extremists ends of the political spectrum. This silenced group includes both men and women, many of whom have reached out to me privately.

I hope this post can serve as some kind of catalyst for the people who already identify with this viewpoint to feel less alone and to find each other.

I AM TAKING A STAND WITH JAMES DAMORE AGAINST LEFTIST AUTHORITARIAN LYNCH MOBS
When I first heard about James Damore’s Memo I thought he probably wrote something that could be characterized as scientifically unsound and offensive, but should not be fired for it.
When I finally found the time to read the actual 10 page memo this week I was shocked.
I couldn’t believe how badly he had been mischaracterized in the media and how much outrage there was on social media considering what he actually wrote.
People claim he said that women aren’t meant for engineering roles when he was merely summarizing the current establised literature of academic personality psychology and was careful to not apply generalizations about populations to specific individuals by wrting, “Many of these differences are small and there’s significant overlap between men and women, so you can’t say anything about an individual given these population level distributions.”
Google’s CEO Sundar Pichai said Damore’s memo violated the “Code of Conduct and crossed the line by advancing harmful gender stereotypes in our workplace” when he was merely stating the descriptive data from a peer reviewed psychology study that used the Big 5 model to explore the question, “How big are gender differences in personality and interests, and how stable are these differences across cultures and over time?”
After I read his actual memo, I realized most people had not read the memo and were more invested in being angry and self-righteous than having an honest inquiry and debating the science.
Overall, I found the memo to be an incredibly reasonable and well argued perspective, on a timely and controversial topic, that was nuanced and deserving of a level headed debate.
I feel compelled to speak up and say that:
I am a liberal, who is for Women Empowerment, who is taking a stand with James Damore.
I am taking a stand against Leftist Authoritarian Lynch Mobs.
I stand with James Damore.
In fact, I am exercising my White Male Privilege to do so.
Furthermore, I am using my Privilege of Self-Employment to be able to stand up to this Mob of Shame and Social Coercion without Fear of Financial Consequences.
I am not ashamed of my White Male Privilege.
I am Emboldened by its Bestowed Responsibility to speak out for Justice and Higher Truth.
I am speaking out against Leftist Authoritarianism.
Let it be known that if you are Angry, you are not Seeing Clearly.
If you are Triggered, you are not Seeing Clearly.

Don’t worry, CNN hasn’t either.
Concerning (former) Google employee James Damore’s ten-page memo outlining his views on the reasons and remedies for gender (and racial) disparity within the company, there is much to be discussed. Did he have a point, or did he, as Google’s Vice President of Diversity, Integrity & Governance, Danielle Brown said, “advance incorrect gender assumptions?” Should he have expressed these views in a workplace setting in the first place? Was Google’s handling of the situation (which ultimately culminated in his firing) in line with their own stated value of upholding diversity, or even legal? There is much rich soil for real debate here.
However, in order to coherently discuss any of these angles, it is necessary to actually read the document in question, which is why it’s so troubling to find that most of the major news outlets covering the story appear not to have done so (and that’s being charitable and assuming that they are not engaging in willful misrepresentation). Although CNN is certainly not the only offender, in the interest of brevity I am going to focus on them as a well-known, mainstream source that has repeatedly referred to the memo’s contents in misleading and outright inaccurate terms.
For example, a write-up in CNN’s tech section by Lauren Segall termed it an “anti-diversity memo” and stated that Damore “argued that women are not biologically fit for tech roles”.
CNN anchor Brooke Baldwin also covered the controversy in her segment on Tuesday. Baldwin introduces the segment by stating that Damore was fired from Google “after blasting diversity and women in the workplace.” Baldwin later paraphrased the memo: “ . . . he’s essentially saying ‘well, I don’t really like women anywhere near a computer’.”

These shameless straw man representations are frankly more appropriate to a backwater Twitter troll than to professionals working for one of the country’s leading news sources.
It’s hard to see how Damore is “anti-diversity” when he states:
I strongly believe in gender and racial diversity, and I think we should strive for more …
I hope it’s clear that I’m not saying that diversity is bad, that Google or society is 100% fair, that we shouldn’t try to correct for existing biases, or that minorities have the same experience of those in the majority.
In fact, Damore puts forward a list of his own suggestions on how to “increase women’s representation in tech and without resorting to discrimination.” His list includes making tech more “people-oriented”, “collaborative”, and “less stressful”, as well as “truly endorsing (as part of our culture) part-time work”.
Damore’s memo, furthermore, does not state anywhere that women are “not biologically fit” for tech jobs. Here’s some of what it does say:
. . . the distribution of preferences and abilities of men and women differ in part due to biological causes and . . . these differences may explain why we don’t see equal representation of women in tech and leadership. Many of these differences are small and there’s significant overlap between men and women, so you can’t say anything about an individual given these population level distributions.
. . . . I’m also not saying that we should restrict people to certain gender roles; I’m advocating for quite the opposite: treat people as individuals, not as just another member of their group (tribalism).
As the excerpts above should show, Damore’s position was not about wanting to keep women out of tech, but rather questioning whether sexism is the only, or even the main factor in disparity, and arguing that Google’s methods to achieve diversity sometimes lead to the very discrimination it is ostensibly trying to avoid. While it would be fair to say that Damore is critical of Google’s methods for achieving diversity, it is grossly unfair to say that he is “anti-diversity.”
Personally, I don’t see Damore’s memo as an unassailable masterpiece of dispassionate logic, and there’s a lot in it that I don’t agree with. Those things are up for debate, but regardless of what I think of his position, CNN’s representation of it has been repeatedly, indefensibly false. If a viewer or reader were to rely on their coverage of the controversy, they would come away with a very inaccurate understanding of the memo’s contents, and therefore, an inaccurate understanding of all the issues surrounding his termination.
In short, the mainstream media’s coverage has resulted in a social media controversy that revolves around a fictional version of the document, which is a regrettable waste of everyone’s time."""

        "content": """First ex-Google engineer James Damore sued his former employer for firing him after he put out a memo saying women aren’t fit for tech jobs. Now another ex-Google worker has brought his own suit against the company after he came out hard against Damore.

Tim Chevalier's complaint—which Wired calls a "new window into the simmering culture war inside Google over diversity"—says Google canned him because he was too "politically liberal" on internal message boards, where he posted comments about Damore's "misogynistic" memo and accused Damore of having "white boy" privilege.

Damore included some of Chevalier's posts in his own suit to prove there was discrimination against white men at Google. Other Chevalier posts that irritated HR included one in which he ripped into GOPers after the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville last summer, per Ars Technica. A manager also reportedly told Chevalier he was too deep into "social activism." Chevalier, who identifies as a "disabled, queer, and transgender" man, says he should have the right to go after those who harass other people and that "anti-discrimination laws are meant to protect marginalized and underrepresented groups, not those who attack them." His suit claims the Google work environment was a "hostile and abusive" one that doesn't protect its female, LGBTQ, and minority workers, per Gizmodo, which notes it spoke to three other current or ex-employees who say they were reprimanded for speaking out on sexism or racism there.

In a statement, Google says it's all for "lively debate," but "like any workplace, that doesn't mean anything goes. All employees acknowledge our code of conduct ... under which promoting harmful stereotypes based on race or gender is prohibited." (A Google search proved this man's innocence.)
