      Office or not, let's aim for a lunch or a dinner. I'm not sure how long you'll be up here, so let me know your availabilities and we'll pick a date.
      I started writing you a list of features but realized that this was going to get unwieldy.
      Here's a link to our stage environment to look at what we've built so far (still alpha): https://stage.lacortenews.com/
      The news feed is most similar to Reddit/Facebook/Axios and can do most of the same things. Here's the stuff that's both different and relevant to you:
      1.    We only do upvotes (boosts), not downvotes
      2.    Each post has one or more tags associated with it, which can range from very broad (\"Movies\") to fairly specific (\"California Wildfires\").
      3.    Users can press the \"Less / More\" button on each post to see its associated tags. Each tag has a slider which goes from 1 to 11 that the user raise or lower to see more or less of that kind of content.
      4.    Each post has an editor assigned \"importance\" score (currently also 1 to 11). If an item has a high importance score, it's placed higher, drops down more slowly, and is more immune to users reduced their sliders for that post's tags.
      5.    Comments work like Reddit, except no downvote option.
      6.    Users post anonymously by default, but can add one or more \"aliases\" to their account which allow them to have one or more persistent identities.
      7.    Additionally, moderators can \"star\" a user that they think is a particularly good poster. The user is never alerted whether or not they've been \"starred\", but if they boost something or reply to a comment, their actions are viewed as more important by the system.
      8.    You can also report comments you think are in violation of a community rule
      Not everything here is built yet, and there's more to our system than just those bullet points, but that should give you a decent idea of what you'd be dealing with.
      We currently have 4 full time developers working on it, as well as additional QA, design, etc., so integrating would be a medium-effort, but if it seems worthwhile we'd prioritize accordingly.
      We also will have a number of editors (probably a couple full time and more part time, but exact number TBD) who will be responsible for finding, submitting, tagging, and adding the importance scores for all the posts in the system. I know ML-folk don't like humans, but we have them, and you'd be able to take advantage of them if you wanted humans to manually classify things.
      I don't plan on pulling any triggers immediately since you guys still need to launch, validate/refine your models, determine how to approach integration (licensing, APIs, etc.), and figure out if that's a path you event want to pursue, but if things start to calcify more on your end and you're still thinking about integrating with us, let me know.
      If you're up in SF or I'm down in LA, let's try to bump into each other and chat nitty-gritty over food.
      Great to meet you too, and it's nice to chat with other people working in this space. I don't know how much Russell has or hasn't told you about us, so here's the (long) three sentence version of our product and vision:
      The reason we're seeing news outlets turn to clickbait and hyperpartisanship is because it's their only way of getting enough clicks to stay profitable. Social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit solved this problem by bringing down the cost of \"creating\" content to essentially $0, allowing them to also do things like personalize the experience for each user. We're building a product that takes the social media concepts of aggregation, personalization, and community and combines them with an old-school news team that submits, tags, and ranks the importance of every piece of content in our system.
      I can imagine a number of potential uses for classifiers like yours in our product, and I'd love to talk more about the specifics of your offering. We're SF based these days, so is there any time in the near future you'll be up here, or would it be better to start with a video call?""",
